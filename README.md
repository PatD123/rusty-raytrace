# Raytracer in Rust...with some other stuff
Still trying to learn Rust and thought this would be a great way to crate (pun intended) stuff using
Rust but also learn a bit more about graphics programming.

## 3d Vectors (Vec 3)
I provide basic vector operation implementations, really those that I needed to follow along with
the [Raytracing In A Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) article.

## Rays
I also provide a basic ray implementation, of course used in raytracing. 
At current moment of development, it is able to shoot rays out and render
a cute lil gradient.
